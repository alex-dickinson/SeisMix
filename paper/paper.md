# Documentation and examples

`SeisMix` is provided with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks that demonstrate its use. The notebooks cover:
- Estimation of diapycnal diffusivity from the spectral signal of turbulence.
- Estimation of diapyncal diffusivity from the spectral signal of internal waves.
- Fitting of the Garrett-Munk model spectrum to observed internal-wave spectra.





<!-- Figures can be included like this:

and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% } -->
